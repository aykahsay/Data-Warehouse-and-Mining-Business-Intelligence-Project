## 🎯 Project Goals

- Build a **Data Warehouse** using **star schema**
- Apply **ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)** processes to raw retail data
- Perform **Data Mining** (Association rules, Clustering, Pattern Discovery)
- Use **Tableau** for building an **interactive dashboard** (KPI, trends, segmentation)
- Gain insights for decision support in retail operations

---

## 🔍 Business Use Case

A retail chain wants to improve:
- **Customer understanding** (through segmentation)
- **Product placement & bundling** (via market basket analysis)
- **Sales forecasting** and **branch-level KPIs**
- **Operational efficiency** using a centralized warehouse
